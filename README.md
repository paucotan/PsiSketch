A mobile-first remote viewing practice application that helps users explore their intuitive perception abilities through a guided drawing experience.

## 🔮 About PsiSketch

PsiSketch is an interactive web application designed for practicing remote viewing exercises. The app guides users through a structured process:

1. **Breathing Exercise**: Begin with a calming breathing exercise to clear your mind
2. **Drawing Phase**: Draw your impressions of a hidden target image
3. **Reveal Phase**: See the target image and compare it with your drawing
4. **Feedback Loop**: Rate your performance and save notes about your experience

The application keeps track of your practice sessions, allowing you to review past attempts and track your progress over time.

## 🌠 What is Remote Viewing?

Remote viewing is like tuning your mind to a hidden radio signal.
It’s the practice of sensing or “seeing” things that are far away—without using your eyes.

It’s not about guessing.
It’s about listening quietly…
To the subtle impressions that float up from somewhere deeper.

People have used it to explore distant places, hidden objects, and even moments in time.
In PsiSketch, you’ll practice by drawing what you sense—before seeing the real image.

There are no wrong answers.
Only the joy of discovering how much more you can perceive.
