Objective:

To create a mobile-first web app that helps users practice intuitive perception (“remote viewing”) by drawing what they sense before revealing a random image. The app fosters inner stillness, mindfulness, and curiosity.

Core Features (MVP):

1. Dark Mode Interface
	•	Default UI theme is dark mode.
	•	Minimalistic, distraction-free design.

2. Breathing/Focus Screen (Optional Start)
	•	Calming breathing animation or countdown (e.g., 30 seconds).
	•	Optional skip button.

3. Drawing Canvas
	•	Fullscreen canvas for finger/stylus/mouse input.
	•	Basic tools: Pen, Eraser, Clear Canvas.
	•	Optional: Color selector (can be omitted for MVP).

4. Random Image Generation (via Unsplash API)
	•	Image fetched only after user finishes drawing.
	•	Categories: diverse, random (nature, architecture, abstract, etc.).
	•	Image is high-quality, fullscreen.

5. Scoring & Feedback
	•	After image is revealed, user self-assesses:
	•	“Hit” / “Miss” / “Maybe”
	•	Optional: add short text or voice note (can be saved as text transcription later).
	•	Button to continue or discard session.

6. Save & Share
	•	Save session (drawing + revealed image + timestamp + feedback).
	•	Option to download image or share (Twitter/X, Instagram Story, or copy link).

7. Score History
	•	Simple local history view (or lightweight cloud storage).
	•	Shows previous sessions: drawing thumbnail, image thumbnail, feedback score.

	Platform:
	•	Web App (responsive for mobile and desktop).
	•	Option to convert into PWA (Progressive Web App) for installable mobile experience.


	Tech Stack Suggestions:
	•	Frontend: React / Vue / HTML-CSS-JS
	•	Drawing Canvas: Fabric.js / HTML Canvas API
	•	Backend (if needed): Firebase / Supabase / Express.js
	•	Image Source: Unsplash API
	•	Storage: LocalStorage for MVP; optional Firebase for cloud sync

	User Flow (Simple):
	1.	Start Session → Optional Breathing Screen → Drawing Canvas
	2.	User Draws → Hits “Reveal”
	3.	Random Image Shows → Scoring Screen (Hit/Miss/Maybe + Feedback)
	4.	User Saves or Shares → Session is stored
	5.	User views Score History (optional end step)
