Analyze this codebase

context:
- This was originally built and deployed with Replit. Running this locally worked at first, until I made changes by moving some files around in the client folder to then host in Vercel.
the changes broke the styling of the app, I pushed the changes to the github repo

So first, i'd like to revert those changes
then i'd like your help to run the codebase locally.
